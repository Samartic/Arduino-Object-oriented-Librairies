# MotorDriver Library for Arduino

The MotorDriver library provides a simplified and efficient way to control motors with your Arduino board. Whether you're working on robotics, automation, or any motor-driven project, this library streamlines the coding process and enables precise control over motor speed and direction.

## Features

- **Easy Setup:** With just a few lines of code, you can integrate the MotorDriver library into your project effortlessly.

- **Motor Configuration:** The `set()` method allows you to define the pins for the motor driver's IN1, IN2, and EN1 (enable) connections.

- **Automatic Initialization:** The `begin()` method takes care of the necessary setup tasks, so you can focus on the core functionality of your project.

- **Smooth Motor Control:** Use the `move(speed)` method to control the motor speed and direction. The `speed` parameter accepts values from -100 to 100, where negative values determine the rotation direction, and the absolute value represents the force applied to the motor.

- **Precise Force Mapping:** The `move(speed)` method automatically maps the absolute value of the `speed` parameter to the appropriate motor force range (0 to 255). This ensures accurate and consistent control over motor intensity.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include <MotorDriver.h>

// Create an instance of the MotorDriver class
MotorDriver myMotor;

void setup() {
  // Configure the motor pins (IN1, IN2, EN1)
  myMotor.set(5, 6, 9);
  // Initialize the motor driver
  myMotor.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Move the motor forward with 70% intensity
  myMotor.move(70);
  delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds

  // Move the motor backward with 50% intensity
  myMotor.move(-50);
  delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds

  // Stop the motor
  myMotor.move(0);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```

# Switch Library for Arduino

The Switch library provides an intuitive and efficient way to interface with switches in your Arduino projects. Whether you're working on home automation, IoT devices, or interactive projects, this library simplifies switch handling and enables easy status checks.

## Features

- **Easy Setup:** With the `set()` method, you can quickly define the pin for the switch, making it hassle-free to configure.

- **Automatic Initialization:** The `begin()` method takes care of the necessary setup tasks, so you can focus on the core functionality of your project.

- **Real-Time Status Updates:** The `update()` method continuously monitors the switch state and updates the `ON` and `OFF` attributes accordingly, making it more logical to use `switch.ON` or `switch.OFF` in your code.

- **Intuitive Attribute Usage:** The library uses `True` (0) for `ON` and `False` (1) for `OFF`, providing a more natural and intuitive way to check the switch status.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include <Switch.h>

// Create an instance of the Switch class
Switch mySwitch;

void setup() {
  // Set the pin for the switch
  mySwitch.set(2);
  // Initialize the switch
  mySwitch.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Continuously update the switch status
  mySwitch.update();

  // Check if the switch is ON
  if (mySwitch.ON) {
    // Perform actions when the switch is ON
  } else {
    // Perform actions when the switch is OFF
  }
}
```
